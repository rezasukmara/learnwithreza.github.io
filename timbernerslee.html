              </div>
            <p>“The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information.”-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>“In an extreme view, the world can be seen as only connections, nothing else. We think of a dictionary as the repository of meaning, but it defines words only in terms of other words. I liked the idea that a piece of information is really defined only by what it's related to, and how it's related. There really is little else to meaning. The structure is everything. There are billions of neurons in our brains, but what are neurons? Just cells. The brain has no knowledge until connections are made between neurons. All that we know, all that we are, comes from the way our neurons are connected.”-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>“Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves.”-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>“What was often difficult for people to understand about the design was that there was nothing else beyond URLs, HTTP and HTML. There was no central computer "controlling" the Web, no single network on which these protocols worked, not even organisation anywhere that "ran" the Web. The Web was not a physical "thing" that existed in a certain "place". It was a "space" in which information could exist.”-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>“I found myself answering the same questions asked frequently of me by different people. It would be so much easier if everyone could just read my database.”-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>“I would have to create a system with common rules that would be acceptable to everyone. That meant as close as possible to no rules at all.”-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>“E-mail allowed messages to be sent from one person to another, but did not form a space in which information could permanently exists and be referred to.”-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>“I had argued that it was ridiculous for a person to have two separate interfaces, one for local information (the desktop of their own computer) and one for remote information (a browser to reach other computers). Why did we need an entire desktop for our own computer but get only a window through which to view the entire rest of the planet? Why, for that matter, should we have folders on our desktop but not on the web?”-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>“Most of systems still depended on some central node to which everything had to be connected [...]. I wanted the act of adding a link to be trivial. If i was, then a web of links could spread evenly across the globe.”-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>“Half-formed ideas, they float around. They come from different places, and the mind has got this wonderful way of somehow just shoveling them around until one day they fit. They may fit not so well, and then we go for a bike ride or something, and it’s better.”-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"Data is a precious thing and will last longer than the systems themselves."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"You affect the world by what you browse."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"The Domain Name Server (DNS) is the Achilles heel of the Web. The important thing is that it's managed responsibly."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"We need diversity of thought in the world to face the new challenges."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"We can't blame the technology when we make mistakes."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"There was a time when people felt the internet was another world, but now people realise it's a tool that we use in this world."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"Anyone who has lost track of time when using a computer knows the propensity to dream, the urge to make dreams come true and the tendency to miss lunch."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"Innovation is serendipity, so you don't know what people will make."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"I don't know whether machine translation will eventually get good enough to allow us to browse people's websites in different languages so you can see how they live in different countries."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"One way to think about the magnitude of the changes to come is to think about how you went about your business before powerful Web search engines. You probably wouldn't have imagined that a world of answers would be available to you in under a second. The next set of advances will have an different effect, but similar in magnitude."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"I don't know whether machine translation will eventually get good enough to allow us to browse people's websites in different languages so you can see how they live in different countries."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"In '93 to '94, every browser had its own flavor of HTML. So it was very difficult to know what you could put in a Web page and reliably have most of your readership see it."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"The amount of control you have over somebody if you can monitor internet activity is amazing."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>

            <p>"Celebrity damages private life."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"The world's urban poor and the illiterate are going to be increasingly disadvantaged and are in danger of being left behind. The web has added a new dimension to the gap between the first world and the developing world. We have to start talking about a human right to connect."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"I myself feel that it is very important that my ISP supplies internet to my house like the water company supplies water to my house. It supplies connectivity with no strings attached."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"Intellectual property is an important legal and cultural issue. Society as a whole has complex issues to face here: private ownership vs. open source, and so on."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"Imagine that everything you are typing is being read by the person you are applying to for your first job. Imagine that it's all going to be seen by your parents and your grandparents and your grandchildren as well."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"When you go onto the internet, if you really rummage around randomly then how do you hope to find something of any of value?"-Tim Berners-Lee</p>

            <p>"Sites need to be able to interact in one single, universal space."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"When it comes to professionalism, it makes sense to talk about being professional in IT. Standards are vital so that IT professionals can provide systems that last."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"Web users ultimately want to get at data quickly and easily. They don't care as much about attractive sites and pretty design."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"What is a Web year now, about three months? And when people can browse around, discover new things, and download them fast, when we all have agents - then Web years could slip by before human beings can notice."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"When something is such a creative medium as the web, the limits to it are our imagination."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"That idea of URL was the basic clue to the universality of the Web. That was the only thing I insisted upon."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"Web pages are designed for people. For the Semantic Web, we need to look at existing databases."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>

            <p>"I suppose it's amazing when you think how many things people get involved in that don't work."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"We could say we want the Web to reflect a vision of the world where everything is done democratically. To do that, we get computers to talk with each other in such a way as to promote that ideal."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"IT professionals have a responsibility to understand the use of standards and the importance of making Web applications that work with any kind of device."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"The important thing is the diversity available on the Web."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>

            <p>"We shouldn't build a technology to colour, or grey out, what people say. The media in general is balanced, although there are a lot of issues to be addressed that the media rightly pick up on."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"The Web is now philosophical engineering. Physics and the Web are both about the relationship between the small and the large."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"I'm not a fan of giving a website a simple number like an IQ rating because like people they can vary in all kinds of different ways. So I'd be interested in different organisations labelling websites in different ways."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"One of the issues of social networking silos is that they have the data and I don't."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"It's interesting that people throughout the existence of the web have been concerned about monopolies."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"The Google algorithm was a significant development. I've had thank-you emails from people whose lives have been saved by information on a medical website or who have found the love of their life on a dating website."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>

            <p>"Physicists analyze systems. Web scientists, however, can create the systems."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>

            <p>"Everybody who runs a Web site knows we're not assured of compatibility, and we could end up with a split."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>

            <p>"The challenge is to manage the Web in an open way-not too much bureaucracy, not subject to political or commercial pressures. The U.S. should demonstrate that it is prepared to share control with the world."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>

            <p>"Any enterprise CEO really ought to be able to ask a question that involves connecting data across the organization, be able to run a company effectively, and especially to be able to respond to unexpected events. Most organizations are missing this ability to connect all the data together."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"Customers need to be given control of their own data-not being tied into a certain manufacturer so that when there are problems they are always obliged to go back to them."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"I want to know if I look up a whole lot of books about some form of cancer that that's not going to get to my insurance company and I'm going to find my insurance premium is going to go up by 5% because they've figured I'm looking at those books."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>

            <p>"I don't mind being, in the public context, referred to as the inventor of the World Wide Web. What I like is that image to be separate from private life, because celebrity damages private life."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"In many ways, people growing up with the Web and now the Semantic Web take the power at their fingertips for granted."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"It's amazing how quickly people on the internet can pick something up, but it's also amazing how quickly they can drop it."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"If you are not on the web, you will have problems accessing services."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>

            <p>"The people who designed the tools that make the Net run had their own ideas for the future."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
            <p>"I have built a moat around myself, along with ways over that moat so that people can ask questions."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>

That's kind of important to me, and that's also kind of important to the whole future of the internet... obviously a closed platform is a serious brake on innovation."-Tim Berners-Lee</p>
